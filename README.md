# AccessVault: A Comprehensive Database Solution for Role-Based Security Management

**This project involves designing and implementing a relational database system to manage discretionary access control for a database management system (DBMS). The primary focus is on creating a structured database schema, implementing it using SQL, and performing various queries and transactions to showcase functionality.**

## Overview
The project is divided into three main parts:

## Part 1: EER Schema Design
Design an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) schema based on the specified requirements.
Document design decisions, assumptions, and any missing or incomplete requirements that were addressed.
Create a clear and comprehensive schema diagram.

##Part 2: Relational Database Schema Implementation
Map the EER schema to a relational schema.
Implement the relational schema using SQL with key and referential integrity constraints.
Document mapping decisions and any changes made to the initial EER design.

## Part 3: Data Loading, Transactions, and Queries
Populate the database with sample data, including user accounts, roles, tables, and privileges.

**Implement and test the following database update transactions:**

Add a new user account.
Add a new role.
Add a new table with its owner.
Add a new privilege and its type.
Relate a user account to a role.
Relate an account privilege to a role.
Relate a relation privilege, role, and table.

# Write queries to:
Retrieve all privileges for a specific role or user account.
Check if a specific privilege is granted to a user account.

# Features
Comprehensive schema design for managing discretionary access control.
Support for binary and ternary relationships among entities.
User-friendly interface for database transactions.
Queries to validate privileges and relationships.
# Technologies Used
## Database Systems: Oracle, MySQL
## Programming Languages: Python 
## Tools: SQLPlus, Draw.io, or MS Visio for diagrams
